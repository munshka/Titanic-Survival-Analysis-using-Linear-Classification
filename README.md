Custom Logistic Regression and KNN Implementation

Welcome to the repository for a machine learning project where I've implemented linear classification and KNN from scratch without using predefined machine learning libraries or functions.
Linear classification is a foundational concept in machine learning and this project serves as a valuable resource for understanding the core principles and mathematics behind linear classifiers. Moreover, KNN is a simple yet effective machine-learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. This project serves as a learning resource for understanding the inner workings of KNN and logistic Regression.
