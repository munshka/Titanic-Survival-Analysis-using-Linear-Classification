Custom Linear Classification Implementation

Welcome to the repository for a machine learning project where I've implemented linear classification from scratch without using any predefined machine learning libraries or functions.
Linear classification is a foundational concept in the field of machine learning and this project serves as a valuable resource for understanding the core principles and mathematics behind linear classifiers.
